1523	Separation of duties prevents conflicts (A), helps stop insider threats (C). Increasing permissions for convenience (B) and unrestricted delegation (D) reduce security.  
1524	Identity proofing is the process of verifying a users identity through thorough background checks to prevent false or fraudulent identities. Assigning access rights or deactivating accounts are part of provisioning/deprovisioning, not proofing. Monitoring activity logs is unrelated to identity proofing.  
1525	Password policies commonly include minimum length to ensure complexity, complexity requirements to prevent weak passwords, and reuse restrictions to avoid repeated passwords. The number of failed login attempts relates to account lockout policies, not password policy itself.  
1526	Federation enables trusted sharing of identities across domains, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple services, improving security and convenience. It does not require multiple credential inputs.  
1527	LDAP, OAuth, and SAML are protocols commonly used in single sign-on and federation systems. SMTP is an email transmission protocol and unrelated here.  
1528	Mandatory Access Control enforces uniform policies typically in high-security environments like government. Unlike DAC, users cannot delegate access; access control is not decided by resource owners.  
1529	Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions based on roles and supports role hierarchies. Unlike DAC, users do not self-assign permissions.  
1530	Something you have factors include smart cards and hardware tokens. Passwords are something you know, fingerprints are something you are.  
1531	Retina and facial recognition are generally considered invasive biometrics due to physical proximity or scanning method; fingerprints and voice recognition are less invasive.  
1532	PAM focuses on monitoring privileged account usage, limiting privileged users, and preventing unauthorized access, not allowing unrestricted access.  
1533	Just-in-time permission management grants privileges only when needed, reducing risk from standing privileges. Permanent privileges increase risk and are discouraged.  
1534	Separation of duties prevents conflicts of interest and increases accountability. It also adds complexity, not simplification.  
1535	Password reuse policies enforce history to prevent repeated passwords and require regular changes. Allowing reuse or never expiring passwords weaken security.  
1536	LDAP is a lightweight protocol often running over port 636 (LDAPS) and supports authentication mechanisms like Kerberos. It is not primarily for email transmission.  
1537	IDS is passive, monitoring traffic; IPS can block traffic inline and is proactive. IDS does not block traffic before the network; IPS is both proactive and reactive.  
1538	Screened subnets segregate networks into zones, protecting public-facing servers and reducing attack surface. They do not remove firewalls or simplify network design in that way.  
1539	False Acceptance Rate, False Rejection Rate, and Crossover Error Rate are biometric metrics; user satisfaction rating is unrelated.  
1540	SSO reduces logins, centralizes authentication, and improves convenience; it does not require multiple passwords per service.  
1541	OAuth manages authorization; OIDC adds identity layer. OAuth alone doesnt provide detailed profiles; OIDC uses REST APIs.  
1542	Identity Providers issue tokens, manage trust, and provide centralized authentication. They do not store passwords for all services.  
1543	Security Token Services issue tokens and coordinate authentication in federated environments but do not monitor network traffic or manage access policies alone.  
1544	Rule-based access controls make decisions based on rules and ACLs, can include time-based restrictions, and do not allow unrestricted access by default.  
1545	Implied deny means access is denied if not explicitly allowed, preventing unauthorized use and requiring explicit allows.  
1546	Effective DLP includes data classification, encryption, and monitoring/alerting. Password changes are unrelated to DLP.  
1547	Web content filtering uses URL filtering, content categorization, and safe search. Allowing all traffic is insecure.  
1548	MFA adds extra authentication factors, reducing risk by combining knowledge, possession, and inherence. Password-only verification is insufficient.  
1549	Ephemeral credentials are temporary and discarded after use, reducing attack surface compared to persistent credentials.  
1550	Behavioral biometrics analyze actions; physiological biometrics analyze physical traits like fingerprints. Passwords are not biometrics.  
1551	Password managers securely store and generate strong passwords, simplifying management and discouraging reuse.  
1552	Provisioning challenges include proper device configuration, lifecycle management, and asset tracking. Ignoring devices is poor practice.  
1553	Policy-based controls allow dynamic decisions based on conditions, improving security with attribute-based access control; they do not remove authentication needs.
